<h1>The boy who chose tech</h1>

<h2>Where the curiosity began</h2>
<p>Ever since I was a kid, I was amazed by technology. I was 7 years old when I received my first gadget, and from that moment, I became very interested in it. I spent a lot of time exploring how it worked and what it could do. That interest slowly turned into an addiction, but it also lit something inside me. As I grew older, that curiosity became my motivation and pushed me to learn more. Since then, I dreamed of becoming someone who works with computers and technology. My father was also in the IT field, which inspired me even more and played a big role in why I chose this path as I grew up.</p>

<h2>Preparing for the real world</h2>
<p>In the future after graduating, I am planning on taking a rest first to prepare myself for the world of an adult. After resting and preparing the documents I need, I will look for potential jobs that suit my skills. I will then hone my skills and gather experience in order to improve them, which I can use in the future for more job opportunities. The career that I want when I start working is a job from home, since I don’t like socializing too much outside. It is also my preference because I won’t have to deal with traffic. I plan to work for companies that provide training and are friendly to fresh graduates, since most companies look for people who already have experience.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Take time to rest and prepare after graduation</li>
  <li>Apply for jobs that match my current skills</li>
  <li>Gain experience and continue improving my abilities</li>
  <li>Prefer a work-from-home setup</li>
  <li>Look for companies that train and support fresh graduates</li>
</ul>

<h2>The future the boy chose</h2>
<p>Choosing technology was not a sudden decision but a dream that grew with me over time. From a young age, my interest in gadgets shaped who I am today. Although the future may be challenging, I am determined to keep learning and improving my skills. With patience, hard work, and experience, I believe that choosing tech will help me build a stable and fulfilling career.</p>
