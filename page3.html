<h1>Escaping the Static</h1>

<h2>Late Blooming</h2>
<p>This is the story of how creating a <i>routine</i> to keep moving helped me get out of <strong>depression</strong>. Standing still led me to do nothing, which gave me too much time to think about negative things. During the pandemic, being stuck in a small space made me feel very alone and made normal life hard. To help myself, I made a routine that kept me busy, giving me less time to think negatively and more time to focus on useful activities and small goals.</p>

<h2>Consistency</h2>
<p>I learned that keeping busy was not just about problems and there theres more it it and its important to keep moving forward in life. I made a routine that was both useful and I also enjoyed since it helped in me being consistent in doing that routine, after a while it became natural as if my day wouldn't be complete if I didn't do it and finishing tasks each day made me feel proud. It gave my days structure and a sense of purpose that was new to me. As days became weeks, the routine became a source of my happinnes and confidence. As I was getting better things were getting harder but whenever I see progress it made the journey easier. This helped me use my energy on positive actions instead of negative thinking, which slowly improved my mental health. There were still times when things felt hard, but having a plan made it easier to face them. Staying active and focused showed me that progress takes time. Each small step reminded me that moving forward, even slowly, is important. Over time, this habit helped me feel confident which also change the way that I interacted with people.</p>

<h2>How it changed me</h2>
<p>Getting out of a static routine meant choosing action instead of staying still. By making and following a routine, I could control my thoughts and decision, make my time useful, and bring purpose back into my life. This experience taught me that small, steady steps can lead to real growth. Moving forward will always be thing that I will continue to do as it helps in a lot of ways.</p>
